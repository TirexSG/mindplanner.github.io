        <h1>Privacy Policy for MindPlanner</h1>
        <h1>Last Updated: June 1, 2025</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>MindPlanner</strong> (hereinafter, "the Application"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our Application.</p>
        
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Application, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Application.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect a minimal amount of information necessary to provide you with our services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Login Information (Google/Facebook):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>When you choose to register or log in to MindPlanner using your Google or Facebook account, we request access to your email address.</li>
              <li>We do not collect or have access to your Google or Facebook password.</li>
              <li>We do not collect any other personal information from your Google or Facebook profile, such as your name (beyond what may be associated with your email if provided by the authentication service), friends list, photos, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the email address you provide for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Profile Creation and Management:</strong> To create and manage your unique user profile within MindPlanner. We use Firebase Authentication to manage your login process and Firestore to store your profile information (essentially, your email address linked to your account).</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity and allow you to securely access your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Functionality:</strong> To enable the basic operation and features of MindPlanner associated with your profile.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
        <p>MindPlanner uses Google AdMob to display advertisements within the Application.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC or Google Ireland Limited, depending on the location from which MindPlanner is accessed.</li>
          <li>AdMob may use cookies, device identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID - GAID, or Apple's Identifier for Advertisers - IDFA), or other technologies to collect information about you and your interactions with ads and the Application. This is done to display ads that may be of interest to you (personalized advertising) or generic ads.</li>
          <li>Information collected by AdMob may include, among other things, information about your device, your IP address (anonymized or truncated where applicable by law), and information about how you interact with ads.</li>
          <li>We do not directly share your email address or other personally identifiable information that we have collected for your profile with AdMob for its own purposes. However, Google, as the provider of AdMob, may have access to certain information as described in its own policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Advertising & Cookies</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising from Google through Google's ad settings on your device or browser.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>Apart from what is described for login functionality (Google/Facebook), profile storage (Firebase), and advertising (AdMob), we do not sell, trade, rent, or share your email address with any other organization or third party for their marketing purposes or any other purpose not described in this policy.</p>
        <p>The service providers we use are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google:</strong> for login, Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and AdMob. Their privacy policies govern the use of the data they process.</li>
          <li><strong>Facebook:</strong> for login. Its privacy policy governs the use of the data it processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend you review the privacy policies of these providers to understand how they handle your information.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase, a Google development platform, which implements industry-standard security measures to protect your account information. While we strive to protect your personal information, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access your information:</strong> You can view the information associated with your profile within the application.</li>
